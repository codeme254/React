# Components

Components are the building blocks of any React Application.

A **component** is a reusable, independent piece of UI that can be combined with other components to build complex
user interfaces.

React components allow developers to break down the UI into reusable, isolated pieces that can be put together to 
form complex user interfaces.

They let us split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

Each component:
- Encapsulates logic and UI in a single function or class.
- Can be used multiple times within a project.

There are two types of components in React:
- **Functional components**
- **Class components** (deprecating)

> A Component in React can be as small as a button or as large as an entire page.
